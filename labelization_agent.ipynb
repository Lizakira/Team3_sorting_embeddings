      "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index \n",
      "published : November 2, 2001\n",
      "El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation \n",
      "The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a \"more complete investigation\" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is \"an abuse of process,\" the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. \n",
      "In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. \n",
      "After the parties file briefs on the ALJ's decision, all that remains is a vote by the commissioners, the El Paso companies pointed out. \n",
      "The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel \"seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head,\" the companies said. \n",
      "\"MOE is attempting to inappropriately influence the decision-making process in this already high profile case,\" putting the integrity of FERC's adjudicatory process in jeopardy. \"The rules under which the complaint is to be judged have become a moving target, El Paso's and Merchant Energy's due process rights and reputation have been harmed, and they have been put in the untenable position of now trying to prove a negative. MOE's improper comments should be disregarded and stricken from the record in this proceeding,\" the companies said. \n",
      "MOE said the issue it was raising -- whether El Paso made its unused capacity available to shippers on an IT basis, as required by FERC's open-access rule -- was neither the focus of the hearing last summer nor Wagner's initial decision (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1) <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011101d.html>.. \n",
      "MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed \"potential violations\" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be \"other potential explanations\" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. \"We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001.\" MOE conceded its motion was an \"unusual\" move. \n",
      "It suggested that the Commission either direct MOE to conduct a further probe, remand the decision to Judge Wagner for consideration or use other procedures. Although \"this step is unusual, it is not unprecedented for the Commission's enforcement staff to inform the Commission of its views regarding potential violations concerning a pending proceeding,\" MOE said. \n",
      "El Paso pointed to a statement by the judge to back up its claim that parties in the proceeding had agreed that the pipeline was full from November through March. \n",

      "rather to \"think dispassionately about the events of last year\" and give Wise \"an independent view\" of the\n",
      "behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the 15-month contract for 1.22 Bcf/day of capacity to\n",
      "California, Langdon explained last week.\n",
      "Wise's decision to hire Langdon was eye-catching on a few levels. In his many years in law practice,\n",
      "Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for, Langdon told\n",
      "Inside FERC, acknowledging \"this really was a little bit of an unusual request.\"\n",
      "Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdon's substantial administration connec-tions.\n",
      "He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon, who as\n",
      "a FERC commissioner in the early 1990s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser.\n",
      "Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition\n",
      "and the possibility that he may have some positive, collateral impact on the commission's ultimate\n",
      "decision in this case?\n",
      "That possibility \"didn't escape me\" at the time, Langdon admitted. \"I'll not pretend to be unaware\n",
      "that there are these other connections with Wood and the president,\" he allowed, adding that \"that's\n",
      "something that impacts everything I do. But what can I do? I have to practice law.\" And, \"for the\n",
      "record, I barely know Pat Wood.\"\n",
      "And how can this be considered an independent, third-party assessment if El Paso is paying for\n",
      "Langdon's services? \"I recognize that there are critics and cynics\" who would suggest that Langdon is\n",
      "simply a hired gun, \"but at the end of the day, . . . I'll have to stand behind\" the report. He vowed to\n",
      "\"call it the way I see it.\"\n",
      "His final report to Wise won't be ready for several weeks, but Langdon shared some of his initial\n",
      "thoughts and findings.\n",
      "Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern\n",
      "California Gas Co. storage facilities - the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County\n",
      "and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County. During the period that roughly coincides with the El\n",
      "Paso/El Paso Merchant contract, SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large\n",
      "volumes of storage gas from those fields, said Langdon. The state commission finally granted the requests\n",
      "in June 2001, the month after termination of the contract, he related.\n",
      "Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso\n",
      "Canyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100,000\n",
      "Dt/day of deliverability to the California gas market \"without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity,\"\n",
      "said Langdon. Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network, he stressed that\n",
      "\"storage is huge\" in moderating the market. When pipeline capacity is constrained, \"storage is a way to\n",
      "take care of . . . these problems.\"\n",
      "And yet, the SoCal Gas applications \"clearly languished\" at the CPUC. \"There may be very good reasons\"\n",
      "why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas, but so far \"I don't understand how the CPUC\n",
      "sits on a storage application like that during this time period when it's as significant as it is.\"\n",
      "For its part, the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state\n",
      "border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its\n",
      "feet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project (IF, 14 May, 5). \"I'm trying not to sound like an\n",
      "advocate in this thing,\" said Langdon, but \"I don't understand the CPUC's position in the case, . . . when\n",
      "right in their own back yard they've got these storage issues.\"\n",
      "As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the\n",
      "contract and subsequently \"withheld massive amounts of capacity\" from the market, \"we've reached the\n",
      "conclusion that we don't see that kind of evidence in what's been presented\" so far in the proceeding, said\n",
      "Langdon. His team of lawyers is looking closely at \"the maze of engineering issues\" that could hold the\n",
      "answer to the capacity withholding issue.\n",
      "Langdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations\n",
      "colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving\n",
      "energy market. Order 497, the marketing-affiliate rule, was first promulgated in 1986, he noted.\n",
      "In most industries, such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace. But here, the\n",
      "gas industry has \"been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of, and yet these rules are the\n",
      "very same ones\" that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years. \"They absolutely need to\n",
      "be updated, end of sentence, end of paragraph,\" said Langdon.\n",
      "Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. about\n",
      "the strength of the El Paso case, Langdon said he was \"not at all concerned about the company not\n",
      "getting a fair shake\" at the commission. Much of what Wagner had to say \"has been sensationalized to\n",
      "a degree\" in the press, he said, adding that \"what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are\n",
      "two different things.\"\n",
      "Langdon admitted that he would be \"a little concerned\" about Wagner's remarks \"if I were litigating\n",
      "the case.\" The judge has used some \"pretty strong language\" to suggest that the El Paso companies were\n",
      "out of line. But FERC \"historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal,\" and \"in this case, the record\n",
      "looks very sound,\" he said. - Chris Newkumet\n",
